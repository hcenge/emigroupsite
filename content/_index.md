As a predominantly operando X-ray spectroscopy group, we push characterisation methods to operate under realistic conditions, probing changes occurring at interfaces and deeper into the bulk of materials, often working closely with experts in computational methods to simulate and interpret spectra. Our work is underpinned by a variety of complementary ex situ techniques, as well as benchmarking of the materials we study to ensure they show representative performance.

We are committed to training the next generation of researchers, fostering rigorous and creative approaches, and promoting the wider adoption of operando approaches across the scientific community.
