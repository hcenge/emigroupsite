Our research is enabled by access to state-of-the-art facilities both locally at Oxford and at international synchrotron facilities.

## Equipment at Rex Richards

### X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy
- **Phi VersaProbe XPS System** - High-resolution surface analysis and depth profiling

### Sample Preparation
- **Thermal Vapor Deposition Systems** - For thin film sample preparation
- **UHV-Compatible Operando Cells** - For studying solid and liquid electrolytes under realistic conditions

## Synchrotron Beamlines

We collaborate closely with international synchrotron facilities to conduct advanced operando X-ray spectroscopy experiments.
