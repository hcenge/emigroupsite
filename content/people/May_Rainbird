May's DPhil project will focus on understanding TCO–HTL recombination junctions in perovskite–silicon tandem solar cells. She will be researching sustainable materials that provide effective passivation and good electrical conductivity. Characterisation methods including synchrotron-based spectroscopy techniques will be used to investigate the chemical, structural, electronic and optical properties of the TCO–HTL interface and the charge transport mechanisms that are occurring.

May studied Chemical Physics at the University of Bristol where her final year project focused on electrochromic tungsten oxide thin films for smart windows. This involved electrodepositing the films before carrying out electrochemical and optical testing and other characterisation methods. Her interest in nanotechnology specifically for solar cell applications has led her to pursue further study in this area including a PGCert in Nanotechnology. Outside of academics she enjoys spending time with her family and friends as well as swing and ballroom dancing and singing.
