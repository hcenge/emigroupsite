    Connor joined the group as a postdoctoral researcher in September 2024 with his work focussing on the development of novel capabilities for operando X-ray measurements of various electrocatalytic systems. Primarily, he is interested in understanding the operating mechanism of highly active alkaline O2 evolution reaction catalysts and the selectivity of CO2 reduction catalysts.

Connor completed his PhD at the University of Southampton Department of Chemistry in 2024 with Prof. Andrea Russell. His PhD focussed on designing a spectro-electrochemical cell for operando XAS measurements of gas evolving and gas consuming reactions. This work focussed on characterising state of the art catalysts for the oxygen evolution reaction, carbon dioxide reduction reaction and oxygen reduction reaction.
