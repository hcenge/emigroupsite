    Francesc’s research centres on investigating metal oxide nanolayers as interconnects in perovskite-silicon tandem solar cells using spectroscopy and synchrotron-based techniques, including XAS, XPS, and UPS. His goal is to correlate spectral changes with improvements in the performance of tandem solar cells.

Francesc joined the group as a Master’s by Research student in October 2025. He graduated from the Autonomous University of Barcelona with a Double BSc degree in Physics and Chemistry. His final project for chemistry involved simulating XAS spectra of selenium compounds to study their presence in plants. 
He then completed a placement at the Netherlands Organization for Applied Scientific Research (TNO), where he worked on recycling solar panels using laser techniques. During his studies, he also undertook internships at the Institut Català d’Investigació Química (ICIQ-CSIC), researching metal oxides as catalysts, and at the Helmholtz-Zentrum Dresden-Rossendorf (HZDR), where he assessed radionuclide levels in soil samples. 
In his free time, Francesc enjoys running and art.
