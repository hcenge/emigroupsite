Jack did his undergraduate and PhD at the University of Liverpool, studying in the department of physics. Here he focussed on understanding factors affecting the performance of wide band gap metal-oxide semiconductors and transparent conducting oxides. He is now employed as a PDRA in the group of Robert Weatherup, at the Materials department at Oxford.
