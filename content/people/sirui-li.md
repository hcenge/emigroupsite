    Sirui’s research interest focuses on hydrogen production. Currently, her research is mainly around size-selected alloy nanoparticles for electrochemical water splitting. A newly acquired deposition method will be investigated in her research to synthesis optimized binary and ternary alloy nanoparticles with well-defined size and composition. Besides electronic spectroscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, she will use advanced operando techniques to monitor changes of the optimized electrocatalysts in real electrochemical reaction environment.

Sirui joined the group in 2023, as a DPhil student. She completed her BSc Materials Science and Engineering from a 2+2 joint program from Central South University and University of Manchester. After completing bachelor’s degree, in 2022, Sirui took MRes in Nanomaterials from Imperial College London, working on the topic of photoelectrochemical water splitting with transient absorption spectroscopy. In her spare time, she enjoys movies, hiking, baking, and crocheting.
