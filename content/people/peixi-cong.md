    Peixi’s research interest centred on elucidating the structure-activity relationship of catalytic materials in situ/operando using cutting-edge X-ray techniques. Currently, he is focused on developing beyond ambient pressure surfaces sensitive methods, and applying them to understand reactions that occur at the surface of solid materials that are crucial to the production of carbon-neutral renewable fuel.

Peixi is a postdoctoral research associate at the Materials Department at the University of Oxford in Prof R Weatherup’s research group. He received a PhD from University College London for the work on "The application of X-ray techniques to identify deactivation processes and active species in novel catalytic materials" under Prof. A Beale's supervision. This work focused on the in situ and operando characterisation of deactivation and active species in catalytic materials with combined X-ray spectroscopic and scattering techniques.
