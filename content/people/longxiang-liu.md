    Longxiang's project focuses on revealing the relationships between the reaction mechanisms observed, the chemical state of the electrocatalysts, and their activity and stability under reaction conditions. Cutting-edge in-situ/operando X-ray techniques are used with homemade electrochemical cells. Additionally, he is interested in developing electrochemical cells for in-situ/operando infrared microscopy characterization.
