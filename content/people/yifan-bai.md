    Yifan’s primary research interests lie in advancing characterisation techniques to elucidate the underlying mechanisms that evolve at the electrode–electrolyte interface in batteries. To pursue this, he intends to utilise in situ and operando characterisation methods, which hold great promise for revealing the dynamic processes governing electrochemical systems. He aspires to push the boundaries of energy research, contributing to a deeper understanding of energy storage devices and the development of next-generation energy solutions.

Yifan joined the Weatherup Group in 2025 to investigate the electrode–electrolyte interface in lithium-ion batteries. He graduated from Imperial College London in 2025 with an MEng in Materials Science and Engineering, awarded with First Class Honours. During his final-year project, he worked in Professor Stephen Skinner’s group, focusing on enhancing the performance of solid oxide fuel cell cathodes at intermediate temperatures. Beyond research, Yifan enjoys swimming, reading, and jogging.
