    Trevorâ€™s interests lie in the areas of electrochemistry (especially energy storage) and surface science. His current research focuses on the degradation of Li-ion batteries, examining how the cathode-electrolyte interface changes with charging and discharging. The main technique for this work is X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), particularly in-situ and operando methodologies. Previously, Trevor has worked on electrochemical carbon capture, examining carbon-based supercapacitors for capturing carbon dioxide.

After growing up in the US (in Los Angeles, California and Austin, Texas), Trevor moved to the UK for university. He completed a BA at Trinity Hall, Cambridge in 2019, studying Natural Sciences with a focus on chemistry. He then undertook an MPhil at Pembroke College, Cambridge, researching supercapacitors for CO<sub>2</sub> capture under the supervision of Alex Forse and finishing in 2021.

After completing the MPhil, he joined the Energy Materials Interface group at Oxford as a DPhil student in 2021. Beyond research, Trevor enjoys climbing, reading (both literary and fantasy novels), and quizzing (having applied many times to University Challenge without getting on the programme).
