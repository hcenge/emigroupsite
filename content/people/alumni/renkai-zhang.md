    Renkai's research focuses on the direct formation of suspended 2D material membranes, with a particular emphasis on graphene. He is exploring different fabrication techniques to encapsulate liquid using graphene so that liquid surface properties can be characterised by X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy under vacuum.
