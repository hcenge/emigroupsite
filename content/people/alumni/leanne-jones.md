    Leanne joined the group as a postdoctoral researcher in June 2022 and her position focusses on chemical vapour deposition (CVD) of 2D materials and their integration with metallic nanoparticles. The aim of this is to modify the electrocatalytic performance through the tuning of the electronic interaction between the two. The chemical and electronic characterisation will be studied with X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy and soft X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy using both lab and synchrotron-based spectrometers at Oxford and at Diamond Lightsource. The goal of the project is to identify relationships between the reaction mechanisms observed, the chemical state of the electrocatalyst, and its stability under reaction conditions.

Leanne obtained her PhD at the University of Liverpool studying the electronic structure of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy coupled with theoretical calculations. As well as TMDs, she has been involved in collaborative projects looking at batteries, PV absorbers, wide band gap oxides and transparent conducting oxides with multiple groups across the University. Her primary focus is x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) of these materials including both soft and hard XPS. In her free time Leanne enjoys going on long walks (that usually end up at the pub!) in the countryside, watching any tv show that includes drag queens, and reading history books.
