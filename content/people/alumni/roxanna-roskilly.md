    Rosanna’s project focuses on size-selected alloy nanoparticles for electrocatalysis, using a new nanoparticle deposition source to investigate the interrelationships between size and composition control. Rosanna is interested in materials for the hydrogen economy and hopes to apply her research to anion exchange membrane water electrolysers to identify promising non-precious metal catalysts for scalable electrolyser deployment. This will involve characterisation using SEM/AFM, XPS and electrochemical methods.
