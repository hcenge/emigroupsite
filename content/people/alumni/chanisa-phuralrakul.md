    Chanisa's research project is focused on improving the performance of all solid-state batteries. Through the modification of solid electrolyte surfaces using additives and processing methods the target is to improve cell performance. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and electrochemical testing are used to track any changes in interfacial composition to aid in the understanding of the chemical reactions occuring whilst achieving this goal.
