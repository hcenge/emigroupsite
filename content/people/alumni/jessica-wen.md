    Jessica’s research aims to develop ultra-thin and impermeable 2D material membranes for encapsulating liquids so that they are leak-tight and can be measured using X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS). The main focus for Jessica’s project is to develop methods to cleanly transfer the 2D material from its growth substrate and suspend them over perforated supports.  Her project will involve characterisation methods including optical microscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Raman spectroscopy and XPS.
