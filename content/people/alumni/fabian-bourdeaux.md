    Applications of quantum effects at nano scale for macroscale properties. As a part of this project, I will be creating Nanoparticles using Magnetron sputtering Gas aggregation for use in the catalysis of the Hydrogen evolution reaction. This will include looking for size effects as well as compositional & morphological effects of the nanoparticles on the effectiveness of materials for use in the HER.
