    Greta’s research is hoping to reveal the impact of vibration on degradation in lithium-ion batteries. To do this she will be focusing on investigating changes to the composition and structure of the electrode interphase layers in NMC811-graphite lithium-ion cells. Electrical impedance spectroscopy as well as destructive techniques such as X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy will be used to aid her investigation.

Greta is a final year materials science student studying at The Queens College. She is completing her master's year research project in Robert Weatherup’s group. In the summer of 2019 she completed a FUSE internship sponsored by the Faraday Institution, where she worked in Mauro Pasta’s group in Oxford researching the solid-state battery material LLZTO. Presenting her research poster at the Faraday conference led to a virtual internship in the summer of 2020 with the early-stage start-up Breathe Battery Technologies. In her spare time she enjoys playing football for Headington Ladies and getting involved in the entrepreneurial scene in Oxford.
