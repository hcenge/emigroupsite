    Michael's research will focus on using high spatially resolved imaging techniques characterising interfaces on state-of-the-art high capacity cathode materials for lithium-ion batteries. As part of Michael’s research project, he intends to adopt a multimodal imaging approach to spatially resolve chemical, ionic and electronic properties of nickel-rich cathode materials at different states of charge and different numbers of charge/discharge cycles. His project will involve the use of photoemission electron microscopy (PEEM), electrochemical strain microscopy (ESM), scanning auger microscopy (SAM), X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (XPS) and secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS).

Michael joined Professor Robert Weatherup’s group in October 2019 as a DPhil student. Prior to coming to Oxford, Michael received his undergraduate degree in Pure and Applied Chemistry (BSc) in 2018 from the University of Strathclyde. He then worked 14 months as a graduate for AGM Batteries Ltd. in Scotland developing prototype high performance lithium-ion batteries for automotive applications. In his spare time Michael enjoys Skiing, watching and playing football.
