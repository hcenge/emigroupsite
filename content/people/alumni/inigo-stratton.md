    I am interested in nanoparticle alloys, so as a part of this project, I will be creating nanoparticles using Magnetron Sputtering Gas Aggregation(MSGA) for use in the catalysis of the hydrogen evolution reaction(HER). This will include looking at how starting composition changes affect the final composition and size distribution of the nanoparticles produced; and ultimately how this affects the electrochemical efficiency of the catalyst for the HER
