    My research interests primarily involve using computational techniques to understand the origin of emergent phenomena in materials for sustainable energy applications. I am currently using density functional theory (DFT) to understand the x-ray absorption spectra (XAS) data collected at the electrolyte-electrode interface of Li-ion batteries.

I received my BA with Honors in Physics from UC Berkeley in 2020, where I worked with the Ginsberg Group as an undergraduate researcher. My undergraduate thesis investigated the self-assembly of gold nanocrystal superlattices by analyzing x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) data. I joined Oxford Materials as a Masters by Research candidate under Dr. Rebecca Nicholls and Prof. Robert Weatherup in Michaelmas 2020.
