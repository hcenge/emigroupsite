    The main aim of Jodie's project is to develop operando battery cells to study the chemical and morphological processes that occur at the anode-electrolyte interface in lithium ion batteries (LIBs). Such insights are crucial for the development of future generation LIBs with longer lifetimes. As an ISIS-Diamond PhD student, Jodie is largely based at Harwell Campus where she frequently uses several synchrotron facilities as well as the EPSCR national facility for X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (Harwell XPS). The main surface-sensitive techniques of interest for Jodie include X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and neutron reflectivity (NR).

    Jodie collaborates closely with several beamline staff including Maria Diaz-Lopez, Prof. Georg Held and Dr Dave Grinter (all Diamond Light Source) and Dr Jos Cooper (ISIS Neutron and Muon Source).

    Jodie's work is associated with a larger degradation project funded by the Faraday Institution.

After completing her MChem at the University of Manchester in 2018, Jodie decided to venture out to the land of The Southrons to join the Weatherup group and inadvertently live out her life as a beamtime junkie.

As a proud Northumbrian and 80-year-old granny at heart, Jodie's outside interests involve reading, crafting, boozy baking, complaining about the noisy neighbours and arguing about where the north (of England) truly begins.
