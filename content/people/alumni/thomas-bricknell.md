    Thomas' research aims to develop ultra-thin and impermeable 2D material membranes (Graphene/hexagonal boron nitride) for encapsulating liquids, so that they can be measured using Operando XPS at near-ambient pressures rather than at the typical UHV. The end goal is to develop a method to cleanly transfer and suspend the membranes over perforated supports. This will allow the study of catalytic reactions and electrode-electrode interfaces under realistic conditions as well as having possible applications in water filtration and desalination.
