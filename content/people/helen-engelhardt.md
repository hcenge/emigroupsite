    Helen's research focuses on the stability and mechanism of electrochemical reactions on alloyed nanoparticle catalysts. Helen is specifically interested in designing earth abundant catalysts for more economical and sustainable HER and OER. An engineer by training, Helen is committed to working on systems that can be applied for the transition to net zero emissions. 
projects:
  - electrocatalysis
  - operando-xray-techniques

Helen joined the group as a DPhil student in October 2024, supported by the Clarendon Fund and an Oxford-Wolfson-Marriott scholarship. She graduated from the University of Waterloo in 2024 with a BASc of Nanotechnology Engineering with Honours. Her final project was a treatment system for removing microplastics from water using iron oxide nanoparticles.

During undergrad, Helen researched CO2 reduction electrochemistry, synthesis of various shapes of gold nanoparticles, and the electrochemical stability of gold nanoparticle catalysts with the Klinkova lab. She also spent 4 months studying metal foil battery electrodes at NRC-Nano with the Fleischauer group. Helen has also interned in industry: she spent 8 months working on separation of Co and Ni for battery recycling at SiTration, and 8 months in microfluidics design for nanomedicine at Precision Nanosystems.

Outside of lab, you might find Helen hiking, playing violin, or knitting a sweater.
