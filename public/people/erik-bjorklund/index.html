He mainly focuses on the chemistries that soon will be in use on the market. He has much experience in analysing the surfaces of the electrodes by XPS and XANES.</p><p>From 2021-2023, Erik was funded by a Marie Sklodowska-Curie Actions (ISOBEL) grant performing research about operando and in situ measurements of battery electrodes as well as finding new ways to recycle cathode materials after they degraded. In the project, electrochemistry was combined with surface science analysing the chemical composition of the electrodes after different cycling conditions. This allowed information from specific degradation conditions to be obtained and analysed. The impact of nickel content in cathode material was of particular interest, including how these materials show more degradation due to electrolyte reactions.</p></div><div class=bbc-person__projects><h2>Projects</h2><ul><li><a href=/research/rechargeable-batteries/>Rechargeable Battery Interfaces</a></li></ul></div></div></header><div class=bbc-person__bio><h2>Biography</h2><p>Erik Björklund started as a postdoctoral research assistant at Oxford in November 2019, working in the Faraday degradation project in Robert Weatherup’s Group. He received his PhD from Uppsala University for analysing how commercial electrode materials degrade during usage. He is mainly focused on combining the understanding of the electrochemistry with the surface degradation product on the outermost nanometres of the electrodes by using XPS.</p><p>With his spare time Erik likes to read books, visit parks and play the board game, Go.</p></div></article></main><footer class=bbc-footer><p>&copy; 2025 EMI Research Group.
