This is especially true for mobile technologies like electric vehicles, where batteries must combine high energy density with long operational lifetimes.</p><p>We focus on understanding one of the key challenges in Li-ion battery development: the unwanted side reactions that occur at the electrode surfaces and lead to degradation over time. To tackle this, we combine electrochemical analysis with advanced x-ray techniques including X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and X-ray Absorption Spectroscopy (XAS) to investigate these processes taking place on the outermost few nanometers of the active particles.</p><p>We are also developing and studying thin film batteries to enable operando studies. These systems use electrodes thin enough that they are transparent to X-rays, and in some cases even electrons, allowing us to perform XAS and XPS during charging/discharging, providing a window into the real time behaviour of buried battery interfaces as they operate.</p><p>Another important area of our research looks at how the classical organic electrolytes can be exchanged by water-based electrolytes. By utilising high concentrations of salt dissolved in water, we aim to design electrolytes with good electrochemical performance, paving the way for safer and cheaper batteries.</p><p>Funding: Faraday Institution Degradation Project, ERC Starting Grant (EXISTAR)</p></div></article></main><footer class=bbc-footer><p>&copy; 2025 EMI Research Group.
