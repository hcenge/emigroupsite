    <p>Observing reactions under operating conditions is essential for uncovering the mechanisms that govern material performance. One of our key research areas is developing and applying operando X-ray spectroscopy methods to directly probe how catalysts and functional materials restructure while they work. A central focus is understanding the complex transformations at solid–liquid, solid–gas, and solid–liquid–gas interfaces, where many important reactions take place. Through close collaboration with multiple international synchrotron facilities, we have established a broad portfolio of operando tools, including: soft and hard X-ray absorption and emission spectroscopy (XAS/XES) – sensitive to electronic structure and local coordination;  X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) – probing surface composition and chemical states;  X-ray diffraction (XRD) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) – capturing structural and phase transitions; Infrared spectroscopy (IR) – bridging vibrational and electronic dynamics. These approaches allow us to follow the evolution of atomic-scale electronic structure, local bonding environments, and surface intermediates under realistic electrochemical bias, temperature, pressure, and reactive gas/liquid conditions. By integrating structural insights with catalytic and electrochemical performance, our operando X-ray studies help identify the true active sites, track dynamic restructuring pathways, and guide the design of next-generation catalysts and energy devices.</p>
<p>Specific areas of active research include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Operando high-pressure soft XAS and XPS for heterogeneous catalysis such as Fischer–Tropsch synthesis, and selective catalytic reduction of NOₓ.</li>
<li>Operando soft XAS of triple-phase interfacial reactions, such as the CO₂ reduction reaction (CO₂RR) and the oxygen evolution reaction (OER).</li>
<li>Operando hard XAS and X-ray scattering on membrane electrode assembly (MEA) electrolysers, to monitor catalyst restructuring and degradation during small-molecule conversion such as CO₂RR, and water splitting.</li>
</ul>
