# Code Changes
- make it look nicer on mobile
- implement a news page using the BBC hero where news is sorted by date and the most recent news is at the top
- Research slug & taxonomy list: document all valid research slugs (e.g., electrocatalysis,rechargeable-batteries) in one place so editors donâ€™t invent mismatched names.
- Logo for the front page
- Add group photos over the years
- research blocks should all be the same size
- update weighting for all so that it is in order of when the person joined the group instead of just a random number
- clean up the css file so that there are no duplicates and use the same theming as much as possible
- round the corners of the icons on the top page so it looks less like the BBC website to prevent copyright issues


# Requires me to update content manually
- add alumni and finish porting all content over from the original website

# Doable after discussion with Paul
- make publications reading and updating more robust, or implement a different way of doing it eg through SSO or by pulling in a live html page of google scholar
- Cron script to update publications weekly
- Set up automated compile and deploy once domain is chosen
